                    Hello, my name is Jenna Abbott. I'm a passionate, twenty-three year old photographer with four years of experience. One of my favorite things about being a photographer, is that I get to meet some amazing people. Not only that, but getting the chance to take part in their special occasion(s). Before I do a photoshoot, I typically prefer to meet the client in person to get a feel for who they are, and what they like. I also aim to make the photoshoot process as informal as possible, in order to give the clients a comfortable, easy, and fun environment instead of an unnecessarily stressful one. If they have any specific photos in mind, I always try my absolute hardest to capture the image that they have in mind.<br />
                    Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!
